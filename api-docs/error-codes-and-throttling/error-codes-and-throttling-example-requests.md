# Error Codes and Throttling - Example Requests

Error codes and throttling are response behaviors, so there are no specific example requests for this topic. Error responses occur when API requests fail validation, authentication, or exceed throttling limits.

Refer to the main documentation for details on error codes and how to handle them in your application.
